		<body>
				<p> 4D Tic Tac Toe is pretty much like the 2 or 3 dimensional versions,
				except you need 5 in a row to win. To represent the 4 dimensional array on a 2 dimensional
				surface we break it into a 5x5 array of 5x5 planes. A win is a straight line in any
				single dimension, or a diagonal win using 2, 3 or all 4 dimensions.
				<p>You can play against the computer, or against another human player, or with yourself,
				but in the middle case the two of you will have to share a computer, as of now there is no network
				support.
				<p>The first player is always called x, so in player vs computer mode, pick "o" in the 
				letter choice radio button if
				you want the computer to go first. You have to click "new game" to switch between 
				player vs player and player vs computer.
				<p>If you're really bored you can watch the computer play against itself.
				<p> The computer takes about 20 seconds to move on my computer, be patient.
				<p> There is an undo button so after you lose you can go back and block the losing square and go on
                    to lose a different way.
